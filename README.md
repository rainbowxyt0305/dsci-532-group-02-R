## Description of the app
This interactive app consists of visualization charts (histograms and color cards) that display the shades (based on lightness) in global best-selling foundation products of different beauty brands around the world. The filters on the top allow users to compare shade distributions by countries and by brands offered in a particular country. On the top charts, users can select the category legends underneath to focus on only one shade distribution, or zoom in on the distributions to closely examine a particular range of shades. There are also customizable sliders in the bottom for users to specify ranges of variables (brightness, hue and saturation), and the app will return the top 5 similar shades available in the specified market based on filter. Both distributions and search results will be updated automatically when changing the filters or sliders.
